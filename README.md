Simple mod for Dyson Sphere Program to distribute Space Warpers from a local ILS or PLS without using up a slot. 

To use simply have one ILS/PLS set to local supply Warpers, all other ILS on the same planet will get Wapers automatically. 

To install use ThunderStore Mod manager https://thunderstore.io/c/dyson-sphere-program/p/BumpyClock/DistributeSpaceWarpers/

I'm pretty new to building mods so expect bugs. If you find an incompatability or a bug create an issue. 

I'm not responsible for borking your saved game. Use at your own risk.
